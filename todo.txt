important:
fine tune decision agent to come up with an step by step json guide to tell other agents which service to use and what tool to use 
fine tune subagent to sort of look at user input and current state of the system to come up with correct inputs for the required tool
use front-end to sort of take the required inputs from the user and add them to the system state and recall the agent that has requested user inputs
   -change frontend to be able to take both required userinput from and also display catalog and taking inputs
-update handle task for most agents
-create an in agent eot to check if everything is done in that agent before going to eot agent
-creating taking required user inputs function
-aws oauth for logins configuration

check if everything is working fine

//*****new*******
check reusing inputs,state_manager
have to create handle functions for each agent along with checking inputs ,etc
have to retrain decision agent to understand large set of input requests and return only tool name not tool task
have to change all st.store messages (based on how reuse works)
to get inputs from user have to include catalogs and all,yeah thats it mostly 
draw system archi again and upload in github--done
